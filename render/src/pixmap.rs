/// A struct representing a pixelmap for pixelflut.

/// This struct holds the data for each pixel, and can be concidered a bitmap.
/// For each pixel, a u32 (DWORD) value is used containing 4 bytes that define
/// the value for each of the 4 color channels.
///
/// This data structure is focussed on performance and multithreaded use with
/// multiple readers and writers.  This structure does not use any kind of
/// locks. Instead, it is assumed that the operations done on the internal map
/// are atomic (on a pixel basis).  This is perfectly fine for what this
/// pixelmap is used for.
///
/// Because this structure is aligned to 4 bytes in memory, each raw color
/// value (u32) is also aligned to 4 bytes. This makes direct reads and writes
/// on these values on most CPUs (but not all!). The fact that this may not be
/// atomic in some cases is accepted for this structure. The speed of not using
/// locks is preferred over the minor side effect of seldom rendering artifact
/// on some systems.
